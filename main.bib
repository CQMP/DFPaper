abstract = {The relation between quantum spin chains and conformal field theories is reexamined. Using a generalized Hubbard model representation it is argued that the critical theory for generic half-odd-integer spin antiferromagnets is the Wess-Zumino-Witten model (WZW model) with topological coupling, k=1, whereas generic integer spin antiferromagnets have an energy gap. The higher-k WZW models (which describe integrable higher spin models) are multicritical points in the space of all spin Hamiltonians. The k=1 WZW model represents a stable fixed point for many theories including WZW models of arbitrary odd k with relevant operators added, generalized Hubbard or Thirring models with an odd number of colors and the O(3) $\sigma$ model at topological angle $\theta$=$\pi$.},

abstract = {The relation between three-dimensional lattice structure and magnetism in correlated electron systems is explored for face centered cubic (FCC), body centered cubic (BCC), and simple cubic (SC) lattices. In particular, we question which lattice structure has the strongest tendency toward the ferromagnetism or antiferromagnetism. We employ the Hubbard model to calculate the spin susceptibility and the single-particle spectrum with the fluctuation-exchange (FLEX) and the two-particle self-consistent (TPSC) approximations in the weak coupling regime. We have shown that (i) ferromagnetic spin fluctuations become dominant when the Fermi level lies around a sharp peak (divergence) in the density of states (D(E)) near the bottom of the band, which occurs for FCC with/without next nearest neighbor hoppings (t') or BCC with an appropriate value of t'. Among the cases studied, the ferromagnetic fluctuation is found to be the strongest for FCC with a finite t'. (ii) When the peak in D(E) resides around the band center as in bipartite SC or BCC, antiferromagnetic fluctuations become dominant when the band is close to the half-filling, with the fluctuation being much stronger in BCC.},

abstract = {Theoretical ideas and experimental results concerning high-temperature superconductors are reviewed. Special emphasis is given to calculations performed with the help of computers applied to models of strongly correlated electrons proposed to describe the two-dimensional CuO2 planes. The review also includes results using several analytical techniques. The one- and three-band Hubbard models and the t-J model are discussed, and their behavior compared against experiments when available. The author found, among the conclusions of the review, that some experimentally observed unusual properties of the cuprates have a natural explanation through Hubbard-like models. In particular, abnormal features like the mid-infrared band of the optical conductivity $\sigma$($\omega$), the new states observed in the gap in photoemission experiments, the behavior of the spin correlations with doping, and the presence of phase separation in the copper oxide superconductors may be explained, at least in part, by these models. Finally, the existence of superconductivity in Hubbard-like models is analyzed. Some aspects of the recently proposed ideas to describe the cuprates as having a dx2-y2 superconducting condensate at low temperatures are discussed. Numerical results favor this scenario over others. It is concluded that computational techniques provide a useful, unbiased tool for studying the difficult regime where electrons are strongly interacting, and that considerable progress can be achieved by comparing numerical results against analytical predictions for the properties of these models. Future directions of the active field of computational studies of correlated electrons are briefly discussed.},

It is shown that TPSC belongs to the \$n\backslash rightarrow \backslash infty \$ limit of the \$O\backslash left( n\backslash right) \$ universality class. However, contrary to the usual approaches, cutoffs appear naturally in the microscopic TPSC theory so that parameter-free calculations can be done for Hubbard models with arbitrary band structure.

Recently, it has become possible to experimentally realize the Fermi-Hubbard model using a fermionic quantum gas loaded into an optical lattice. In this atomic approach to the Fermi-Hubbard model the Hamiltonian is a direct result of the optical lattice potential created by interfering laser fields and short-ranged ultracold collisions. It provides a route to simulate the physics of the Hamiltonian and to address open questions and novel challenges of the underlying many-body system. This review gives an overview of the current efforts in understanding and realizing experiments with fermionic atoms in optical lattices and discusses key experiments in the metallic, band-insulating, superfluid and Mott-insulating regimes.},

abstract = {The four-site DCA method of including intersite correlations in the dynamical mean field theory is used to investigate the metal-insulator transition in the Hubbard model. At half filling a gap-opening transition is found to occur as the interaction strength is increased beyond a critical value. The gapped behavior found in the 4-site DCA approximation is shown to be associated with the onset of strong antiferromagnetic and singlet correlations and the transition is found to be potential energy driven. It is thus more accurately described as a Slater phenomenon (induced by strong short ranged order) than as a Mott phenomenon. Doping the gapped phase leads to a non-Fermi-liquid state with a Fermi surface only in the nodal regions and a pseudogap in the antinodal regions at lower dopings \$x \backslash lesssim 0.15\$ and to a Fermi liquid phase at higher dopings.},

abstract = {Strongly correlated quantum impurity problems appear in a wide variety of contexts ranging from nanoscience and surface physics to material science and the theory of strongly correlated lattice models, where they appear as auxiliary systems within dynamical mean-field theory. Accurate and unbiased solutions must usually be obtained numerically, and continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo algorithms, a family of algorithms based on the stochastic sampling of partition function expansions, perform well for such systems. With the present paper we provide an efficient and generic implementation of the hybridization expansion quantum impurity solver, based on the segment representation. We provide a complete implementation featuring most of the recently developed extensions and optimizations. Our implementation allows one to treat retarded interactions and provides generalized measurement routines based on improved estimators for the self-energy and for vertex functions. The solver is embedded in the ALPS-DMFT application package.

External routines: ALPS [1, 2, 3], BLAS [4, 5], LAPACK [6], HDF5 [7] Nature of problem: Quantum impurity models were originally introduced to describe a magnetic transition metal ion in a non-magnetic host metal. They are widely used today. In nanoscience they serve as representations of quantum dots and molecular conductors. In condensed matter physics, they are playing an increasingly important role in the description of strongly correlated electron materials, where the complicated many-body problem is mapped onto an auxiliary quantum impurity model in the context of dynamical mean-field theory, and its cluster and diagrammatic extensions. They still constitutes a non-trivial many-body problem, which takes into account the (possibly retarded) interaction between electrons occupying the impurity site. Electrons are allowed to dynamically hop on and off the impurity site, which is described by a time-dependent hybridization function. Solution method: The quantum impurity model is solved using a continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo algorithm which is based on a perturbation expansion of the partition function in the impurity–bath hybridization. Monte Carlo configurations are represented as segments on the imaginary time interval and individual terms correspond to Feynman diagrams which are stochastically sampled to all orders using a Metropolis algorithm.

abstract = {Ultracold atoms in optical lattices are a versatile platform for creating quantum many-body states of matter. These systems may be able to address some of the most important issues in many-body physics, such as high-temperature (high-\$T\_c\$) superconductivity. The Hubbard model describes many of the features shared by the cuprate superconductors, including an interaction-driven Mott insulating state and antiferromagnetism (AFM). Optical lattices filled with a two-spin-component Fermi gas of ultracold atoms can faithfully realize the Hubbard model with readily tunable parameters, and thus provide a platform for its systematic exploration. Realization of strongly correlated phases in optical lattices, however, has been hindered by the need to cool the atoms to temperatures as low as the magnetic exchange energy, and also by the lack of reliable thermometry. Here we demonstrate spin-sensitive Bragg scattering of light, in analogy to neutron scattering in condensed matter, and use it to measure the spin correlations at temperatures down to 1.4 times that of the AFM phase transition. We achieve these low temperatures using a novel compensated lattice to flatten the confining potential, tune the density, and mitigate heating in the lattice. We deduce the temperature of the atoms in the lattice by comparing the light scattering to determinantal quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) and numerical linked-cluster expansion (NLCE) calculations, using the local density approximation (LDA) to account for the inhomogeneity of the density. Further refinement of the compensated lattice may produce even lower temperatures which, along with light scattering thermometry, has important implications for achieving other novel quantum states and addressing the role of the Hubbard model in cuprate superconductivity.},

In one set of simulations we employ the usual finite-size scaling methods to compute the critical exponents $\nu$,$\alpha$,$\beta$,$\gamma$,$\eta$ from a few measurements in the vicinity of the critical point, making extensive use of histogram reweighting and optimization techniques. In another set of simulations we report measurements of improved estimators for the spatial correlation length and the susceptibility in the high-temperature phase, obtained on lattices with up to 1003 spins. This enables us to compute independent estimates of $\nu$ and $\gamma$ from power-law fits of their critical divergencies.},

abstract = {We formulate the dual fermion approach to strongly correlated electronic systems in terms of the lattice and dual effective interactions, obtained by using the covariation splitting formula. This allows us to consider the effect of six-point one-particle reducible interactions, which are usually neglected by the dual fermion approach. We show that the consideration of one-particle reducible six-point (as well as higher order) vertices is crucially important for the diagrammatic consistency of this approach. In particular, the relation between the dual and lattice self-energy, derived in the dual fermion approach, implicitly accounts for the effect of the diagrams, containing 6-point and higher order local one-particle reducible vertices, and should be applied with caution, if these vertices are neglected. Apart from that, the treatment of the self-energy feedback is also modified by 6-point and higher order vertices; these vertices are also important to account for some non-local corrections to the lattice self-energy, which have the same order in the local 4-point vertices, as the diagrams usually considered in the approach. These observations enlighten an importance of 6-point and higher order vertices in the dual fermion approach, and call for development of new schemes of treatment of non-local fluctuations, which are based on one-particle irreducible quantities.},

Our results show the suppression of the quasiparticle weight in three dimensions and dramatically stronger impact of spin fluctuations in two dimensions where the pseudogap is formed at low enough temperatures. Even in the presence of the Hubbard subbands, the origin of the pseudogap at weak-to-intermediate coupling is in the splitting of the quasiparticle peak. At stronger coupling (closer to the insulating phase) the splitting of Hubbard subbands is expected instead. The k dependence of the self-energy appears to be also much more pronounced in two dimensions as can be observed in the k-resolved D$\Gamma$A spectra, experimentally accessible by angular resolved photoemission spectroscopy in layered correlated systems.},

The mass remains strongly enhanced in the non-half-filled-band case. We also stress the difference between magnetic and non-magnetic contributions to the gap. These results are discussed within the slave boson approach in the saddle-point approximation, in which there appears a non-linear staggered molecular field due to the electronic correlations that leads to the appearance of the magnetic gap. They reproduce correctly the ground-state energy in the limit of strong correlations. A brief comparison with the solution in the limit of infinite dimensions and the corresponding situation in the doubly-degenerate-band case with one electron per atom is also made.},

Cases where agreement between different methods is obtained establish benchmark results that may be useful in the validation of new approaches and the improvement of existing methods.},

Both existing theoretical concepts and experimental data on selected materials are presented; with the aim of assessing the validity of presently available theory. After briefly recalling the fundamentals of Fermi-liquid theory, the local Fermi-liquid state in quantum impurity models and their lattice versions is described. Next, the scaling concepts applicable to quantum phase transitions are presented. The Hertz-Millis-Moriya theory of quantum phase transitions is described in detail. The breakdown of the latter is analyzed in several examples. In the final part, experimental data on heavy-fermion materials and transition-metal alloys are reviewed and confronted with existing theory.},

A diagrammatic self-consistent approach is used, and a second-order self-energy is calculated in order to take into account local fluctuations. Our results show a decrease of the superconductor gap and critical temperature with respect to the mean-field solution. The ratio 2-DELTA/k(B)T(c) is not modified, however, by the local fluctuations if the self-energy matrix in a site representation extends only to the lattice nearest neighbors. In this approximation, the superconductor gap is found to be constant along the Fermi surface. Further nearest-neighbor interactions introduce a superconductor gap that changes along this surface.},

We determine the equation of state for the 3D repulsive Fermi-Hubbard model as a function of the chemical potential, temperature and repulsion using unbiased determinantal quantum Monte Carlo methods, and we then use the local density approximation to model a harmonic trap. We show that increasing repulsion leads to cooling, but only in a trap, due to the redistribution of entropy from the center to the metallic wings. Thus, even when the average entropy per particle is larger than that required for antiferromagnetism in the homogeneous system, the trap enables the formation of an AF Mott phase.},

abstract = {We present an efficient diagrammatic method to describe nonlocal correlation effects in lattice fermion Hubbard-type models, which is based on a change of variables in the Grassmann path integrals. The new fermions are dual to the original ones and correspond to weakly interacting quasiparticles in the case of strong local correlations in the Hubbard model. The method starts with dynamical mean-field theory as a zeroth-order approximation and includes nonlocal effects in a perturbative way. In contrast to cluster approaches, this method utilizes an exact transition to a dual set of variables. It therefore becomes possible to treat vertices of an effective single-impurity problem as small parameters. This provides a very efficient interpolation between bandlike weak-coupling and atomic limits. The method is illustrated on the two-dimensional Hubbard model. The antiferromagnetic pseudogap, Fermi-arc formations, and non-Fermi-liquid effects due to the Van Hove singularity are correctly reproduced by the lowest-order diagrams. Extremum properties of the dual fermion approach are discussed in terms of the Feynman variational principle.},

abstract = {The Hartree-Fock equations state that each electron in an atom or molecular system should move in a different potential. In some cases, particularly magnetic cases, this leads to important consequences, since electrons with opposite spins move in different potentials. In particular, in an antiferromagnetic substance, electrons of + and - spin have different potentials; and for an electron of + spin, for instance, the potential energy is lower in those atoms whose spins are pointed in the + direction than in those with the opposite spin. This results in a periodic perturbation of potential, with periodicity twice the atomic periodicity, and leads to a splitting of each energy band in half, with a gap in the middle. In a case where the energy band was half full, resulting in a conductor: when we disregard this effect, the resulting half-band will be just filled when we consider it; this may explain the insulating nature of some antiferromagnetics. A similar argument applied to a diatomic molecule like H2 can result in two alternative types of solutions of the Hartree-Fock equations: one leading to atomic orbitals, the other to molecular orbitals. The solution with atomic orbitals shows an analogy to the antiferromagnetic problem; that with ordinary molecular orbitals shows an analogy to the band theory of a non-magnetic conductor.},

abstract = {A new approach to the single-band Hubbard model is described in the general context of many-body theories. It is based on enforcing conservation laws, the Pauli principle and a number of crucial sum-rules. More specifically, spin and charge susceptibilities are expressed, in a conserving approximation, as a function of two constant irreducible vertices whose values are found self-consistently. The Mermin-Wagner theorem in two dimensions is automatically satisfied. The effect of collective modes on single-particle properties is then obtained by a paramagnon-like formula that is consistent with the two-particle properties in the sense that the potential energy obtained from \$Tr\backslash Sigma G\$ is identical to that obtained using the fluctuation-dissipation theorem for susceptibilities. The vertex corrections are included through constant irreducible vertices. The theory is in quantitative agreement with Monte Carlo simulations for both single-particle and two-particle properties. In the two-dimensional renormalized classical regime, spin fluctuations lead to precursors of antiferromagnetic bands (shadow bands) and to the destruction of the Fermi-liquid quasiparticles in a wide temperature range above the zero-temperature phase transition. The analogous phenomenon of pairing pseudogap can occur in the attractive model in two dimensions when the pairing fluctuations become critical. Other many-body approaches are critically compared. It is argued that treating the spin fluctuations as if there was a Migdal's theorem can lead to wrong predictions, in particular with regard to the the single-particle pseudogap.},

The collective variables for charge and spin are isolated in the form of the space-time fluctuating U(1) phase field and rotating spin quantization axis governed by the SU(2) symmetry, respectively. As a result interacting electrons appear as a composite objects consisting of bare fermions with attached U(1) and SU(2) gauge fields. An effective action consisting of a spin-charge rotor and a fermionic fields is derived as a function of the Coulomb repulsion U and hopping parameter t. At zero temperature, our theory describes the evolution from a Slater (U<<t) to a Mott-Heisenberg (U>>t) antiferromagnet.
