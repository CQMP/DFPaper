We find a very good quantitative agreement with Dynamical Mean-Field results for the isotropic 3d model. Calculations on finite size lattices also provide satisfactory comparisons with Monte Carlo results up to the intermediate coupling regime. We point out a qualitative difference between the isotropic 3d case, and the 2d or anisotropic 3d cases for the double occupation factor. Even for this local correlation function, 2d or anisotropic 3d cases are out of reach of DMF: this comes from the inability of DMF to account for antiferromagnetic fluctuations, which are crucial.},

abstract = {Ultracold atoms in optical lattices are a versatile platform for creating quantum many-body states of matter. These systems may be able to address some of the most important issues in many-body physics, such as high-temperature (high-\$T\_c\$) superconductivity. The Hubbard model describes many of the features shared by the cuprate superconductors, including an interaction-driven Mott insulating state and antiferromagnetism (AFM). Optical lattices filled with a two-spin-component Fermi gas of ultracold atoms can faithfully realize the Hubbard model with readily tunable parameters, and thus provide a platform for its systematic exploration. Realization of strongly correlated phases in optical lattices, however, has been hindered by the need to cool the atoms to temperatures as low as the magnetic exchange energy, and also by the lack of reliable thermometry. Here we demonstrate spin-sensitive Bragg scattering of light, in analogy to neutron scattering in condensed matter, and use it to measure the spin correlations at temperatures down to 1.4 times that of the AFM phase transition. We achieve these low temperatures using a novel compensated lattice to flatten the confining potential, tune the density, and mitigate heating in the lattice. We deduce the temperature of the atoms in the lattice by comparing the light scattering to determinantal quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) and numerical linked-cluster expansion (NLCE) calculations, using the local density approximation (LDA) to account for the inhomogeneity of the density. Further refinement of the compensated lattice may produce even lower temperatures which, along with light scattering thermometry, has important implications for achieving other novel quantum states and addressing the role of the Hubbard model in cuprate superconductivity.},

abstract = {We have simulated the three-dimensional Heisenberg model on simple cubic lattices, using the single-cluster Monte Carlo update algorithm. The expected pronounced reduction of critical slowing down at the phase transition is verified. This allows simulations on significantly larger lattices than in previous studies and consequently a better control over systematic errors. In one set of simulations we employ the usual finite-size scaling methods to compute the critical exponents $\nu$,$\alpha$,$\beta$,$\gamma$,$\eta$ from a few measurements in the vicinity of the critical point, making extensive use of histogram reweighting and optimization techniques. In another set of simulations we report measurements of improved estimators for the spatial correlation length and the susceptibility in the high-temperature phase, obtained on lattices with up to 1003 spins. This enables us to compute independent estimates of $\nu$ and $\gamma$ from power-law fits of their critical divergencies.},

abstract = {We formulate the dual fermion approach to strongly correlated electronic systems in terms of the lattice and dual effective interactions, obtained by using the covariation splitting formula. This allows us to consider the effect of six-point one-particle reducible interactions, which are usually neglected by the dual fermion approach. We show that the consideration of one-particle reducible six-point (as well as higher order) vertices is crucially important for the diagrammatic consistency of this approach. In particular, the relation between the dual and lattice self-energy, derived in the dual fermion approach, implicitly accounts for the effect of the diagrams, containing 6-point and higher order local one-particle reducible vertices, and should be applied with caution, if these vertices are neglected. Apart from that, the treatment of the self-energy feedback is also modified by 6-point and higher order vertices; these vertices are also important to account for some non-local corrections to the lattice self-energy, which have the same order in the local 4-point vertices, as the diagrams usually considered in the approach. These observations enlighten an importance of 6-point and higher order vertices in the dual fermion approach, and call for development of new schemes of treatment of non-local fluctuations, which are based on one-particle irreducible quantities.},

abstract = {We use the dynamical vertex approximation (D$\Gamma$A) with a Moriyaesque $\lambda$ correction for studying the impact of antiferromagnetic fluctuations on the spectral function of the Hubbard model in two and three dimensions. Our results show the suppression of the quasiparticle weight in three dimensions and dramatically stronger impact of spin fluctuations in two dimensions where the pseudogap is formed at low enough temperatures. Even in the presence of the Hubbard subbands, the origin of the pseudogap at weak-to-intermediate coupling is in the splitting of the quasiparticle peak. At stronger coupling (closer to the insulating phase) the splitting of Hubbard subbands is expected instead. The k dependence of the self-energy appears to be also much more pronounced in two dimensions as can be observed in the k-resolved D$\Gamma$A spectra, experimentally accessible by angular resolved photoemission spectroscopy in layered correlated systems.},

The mass remains strongly enhanced in the non-half-filled-band case. We also stress the difference between magnetic and non-magnetic contributions to the gap. These results are discussed within the slave boson approach in the saddle-point approximation, in which there appears a non-linear staggered molecular field due to the electronic correlations that leads to the appearance of the magnetic gap. They reproduce correctly the ground-state energy in the limit of strong correlations. A brief comparison with the solution in the limit of infinite dimensions and the corresponding situation in the doubly-degenerate-band case with one electron per atom is also made.},

abstract = {We present an efficient diagrammatic method to describe nonlocal correlation effects in lattice fermion Hubbard-type models, which is based on a change of variables in the Grassmann path integrals. The new fermions are dual to the original ones and correspond to weakly interacting quasiparticles in the case of strong local correlations in the Hubbard model. The method starts with dynamical mean-field theory as a zeroth-order approximation and includes nonlocal effects in a perturbative way. In contrast to cluster approaches, this method utilizes an exact transition to a dual set of variables. It therefore becomes possible to treat vertices of an effective single-impurity problem as small parameters. This provides a very efficient interpolation between bandlike weak-coupling and atomic limits. The method is illustrated on the two-dimensional Hubbard model. The antiferromagnetic pseudogap, Fermi-arc formations, and non-Fermi-liquid effects due to the Van Hove singularity are correctly reproduced by the lowest-order diagrams. Extremum properties of the dual fermion approach are discussed in terms of the Feynman variational principle.},

@article{Slater1951,
abstract = {The Hartree-Fock equations state that each electron in an atom or molecular system should move in a different potential. In some cases, particularly magnetic cases, this leads to important consequences, since electrons with opposite spins move in different potentials. In particular, in an antiferromagnetic substance, electrons of + and - spin have different potentials; and for an electron of + spin, for instance, the potential energy is lower in those atoms whose spins are pointed in the + direction than in those with the opposite spin. This results in a periodic perturbation of potential, with periodicity twice the atomic periodicity, and leads to a splitting of each energy band in half, with a gap in the middle. In a case where the energy band was half full, resulting in a conductor: when we disregard this effect, the resulting half-band will be just filled when we consider it; this may explain the insulating nature of some antiferromagnetics. A similar argument applied to a diatomic molecule like H2 can result in two alternative types of solutions of the Hartree-Fock equations: one leading to atomic orbitals, the other to molecular orbitals. The solution with atomic orbitals shows an analogy to the antiferromagnetic problem; that with ordinary molecular orbitals shows an analogy to the band theory of a non-magnetic conductor.},
